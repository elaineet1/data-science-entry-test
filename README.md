Pre-assessment for (SCTP) Data Science and AI

Advanced Professional Certificate (Full-Time), 26 January 2026 to 30 April 2026

This repository holds my pre-assessment attempts for the SCTP Data Science and AI programme offered by NTU. The exercises are written in Python. 
I use this space to practice, learn, and improve along the way.
The work here reflects my current learning journey. I expect to keep refining as I grow more confident with coding.
