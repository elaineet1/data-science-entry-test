Pre-assessment for (SCTP) Data Science and AI

Advanced Professional Certificate (Full-Time), 26 January 2026 to 30 April 2026

This repository holds my pre-assessment attempts for the SCTP Data Science and AI programme offered by NTU. I am new to programming, and I am learning Python step by step. This space is where I practice, explore, and make mistakes as I build my foundation. The work here reflects my starting point, and I will continue improving as I grow more confident over time.
